Special Recognition: I always do participate in various study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Forest Prodan, Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Maria Wolfgang, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, and William Brewer. Although I did attend office hours and study groups, always find Andrew Clifft to be a wealth of knowledge, and still collaborated with Angela Reed and Josh Gibson for this project, I spent more time with the AskBCS Learning Assistants this week than ever before because I continue to struggle with simple syntax.
